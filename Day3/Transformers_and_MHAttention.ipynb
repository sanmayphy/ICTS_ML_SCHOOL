    "In this tutorial, we will discuss one of the most impactful architectures of the last 2 years: the Transformer model. Since the paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. had been published in 2017, the Transformer architecture has continued to beat benchmarks in many domains, most importantly in Natural Language Processing. Transformers with an incredible amount of parameters can generate long, convincing [essays](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3), and opened up new application fields of AI. As the hype of the Transformer architecture seems not to come to an end in the next years, it is important to understand how it works, and have implemented it yourself, which we will do in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the huge success of Transformers in NLP, we will _not_ include the NLP domain in our notebook here. Why? Firstly, the Master AI at UvA offers many great NLP courses that will take a closer look at the application of the Transformer architecture in NLP ([NLP2](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2020-2021/zoek-vak/vak/79628), [Advanced Topics in Computational Semantics](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2020-2021/zoek-vak/vak/80162)). Secondly, assignment 2 takes already a closer look at language generation on character level, on which you could easily apply our transformer architecture. Finally, and most importantly, there is so much more to the Transformer architecture. NLP is the domain the Transformer architecture has been originally proposed for and had the greatest impact on, but it also accelerated research in other domains, recently even [Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929). Thus, we focus here on what makes the Transformer and self-attention so powerful in general. In [Tutorial 15](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial15/Vision_Transformer.html), we will discuss the application of Transformers in Computer Vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we import our standard libraries. Similarly as in Tutorial 5, we will use [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) as an additional framework. If you are not familiar with PyTorch Lightning, please make sure to have read Tutorial 5 carefully."

    "### What is Attention?\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention mechanism describes a recent new group of layers in neural networks that has attracted a lot of interest in the past few years, especially in sequence tasks. There are a lot of different possible definitions of \"attention\" in the literature, but the one we will use here is the following: _the attention mechanism describes a weighted average of (sequence) elements with the weights dynamically computed based on an input query and elements' keys_. So what does this exactly mean? The goal is to take an average over the features of multiple elements. However, instead of weighting each element equally, we want to weight them depending on their actual values. In other words, we want to dynamically decide on which inputs we want to \"attend\" more than others. In particular, an attention mechanism has usually four parts we need to specify:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Query**: The query is a feature vector that describes what we are looking for in the sequence, i.e. what would we maybe want to pay attention to.\n",
    "* **Keys**: For each input element, we have a key which is again a feature vector. This feature vector roughly describes what the element is \"offering\", or when it might be important. The keys should be designed such that we can identify the elements we want to pay attention to based on the query.\n",
    "* **Values**: For each input element, we also have a value vector. This feature vector is the one we want to average over.\n",
    "* **Score function**: To rate which elements we want to pay attention to, we need to specify a score function $f_{attn}$. The score function takes the query and a key as input, and output the score/attention weight of the query-key pair. It is usually implemented by simple similarity metrics like a dot product, or a small MLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights of the average are calculated by a softmax over all score function outputs. Hence, we assign those value vectors a higher weight whose corresponding key is most similar to the query. If we try to describe it with pseudo-math, we can write: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha_i = \\frac{\\exp\\left(f_{attn}\\left(\\text{key}_i, \\text{query}\\right)\\right)}{\\sum_j \\exp\\left(f_{attn}\\left(\\text{key}_j, \\text{query}\\right)\\right)}, \\hspace{5mm} \\text{out} = \\sum_i \\alpha_i \\cdot \\text{value}_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually, we can show the attention over a sequence of words as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\" style=\"padding:25px\"><img src=\"transformer_architecture.jpg\" width=\"750px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "For every word, we have one key and one value vector. The query is compared to all keys with a score function (in this case the dot product) to determine the weights. The softmax is not visualized for simplicity. Finally, the value vectors of all words are averaged using the attention weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most attention mechanisms differ in terms of what queries they use, how the key and value vectors are defined, and what score function is used. The attention applied inside the Transformer architecture is called **self-attention**. In self-attention, each sequence element provides a key, value, and query. For each element, we perform an attention layer where based on its query, we check the similarity of the all sequence elements' keys, and returned a different, averaged value vector for each element. We will now go into a bit more detail by first looking at the specific implementation of the attention mechanism which is in the Transformer case the scaled dot product attention."

    "### Scaled Dot Product Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept behind self-attention is the scaled dot product attention. Our goal is to have an attention mechanism with which any element in a sequence can attend to any other while still being efficient to compute. The dot product attention takes as input a set of queries $Q\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d_k}$, keys $K\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d_k}$ and values $V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d_v}$ where $T$ is the sequence length, and $d_k$ and $d_v$ are the hidden dimensionality for queries/keys and values respectively. For simplicity, we neglect the batch dimension for now. The attention value from element $i$ to $j$ is based on its similarity of the query $Q_i$ and key $K_j$, using the dot product as the similarity metric. In math, we calculate the dot product attention as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix multiplication $QK^T$ performs the dot product for every possible pair of queries and keys, resulting in a matrix of the shape $T\\times T$. Each row represents the attention logits for a specific element $i$ to all other elements in the sequence. On these, we apply a softmax and multiply with the value vector to obtain a weighted mean (the weights being determined by the attention). Another perspective on this attention mechanism offers the computation graph which is visualized below (figure credit - [Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\"><img src=\"attention.png\" width=\"210px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect we haven't discussed yet is the scaling factor of $1/\\sqrt{d_k}$. This scaling factor is crucial to maintain an appropriate variance of attention values after initialization. Remember that we intialize our layers with the intention of having equal variance throughout the model, and hence, $Q$ and $K$ might also have a variance close to $1$. However, performing a dot product over two vectors with a variance $\\sigma^2$ results in a scalar having $d_k$-times higher variance: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$q_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2), k_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2) \\to \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{d_k} q_i\\cdot k_i\\right) = \\sigma^4\\cdot d_k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do not scale down the variance back to $\\sim\\sigma^2$, the softmax over the logits will already saturate to $1$ for one random element and $0$ for all others. The gradients through the softmax will be close to zero so that we can't learn the parameters appropriately. Note that the extra factor of $\\sigma^2$, i.e., having $\\sigma^4$ instead of $\\sigma^2$, is usually not an issue, since we keep the original variance $\\sigma^2$ close to $1$ anyways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The block `Mask (opt.)` in the diagram above represents the optional masking of specific entries in the attention matrix. This is for instance used if we stack multiple sequences with different lengths into a batch. To still benefit from parallelization in PyTorch, we pad the sentences to the same length and mask out the padding tokens during the calculation of the attention values. This is usually done by setting the respective attention logits to a very low value. \n",

    "### Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "The scaled dot product attention allows a network to attend over a sequence. However, often there are multiple different aspects a sequence element wants to attend to, and a single weighted average is not a good option for it. This is why we extend the attention mechanisms to multiple heads, i.e. multiple different query-key-value triplets on the same features. Specifically, given a query, key, and value matrix, we transform those into $h$ sub-queries, sub-keys, and sub-values, which we pass through the scaled dot product attention independently. Afterward, we concatenate the heads and combine them with a final weight matrix. Mathematically, we can express this operation as:\n",

    "One crucial characteristic of the multi-head attention is that it is permutation-equivariant with respect to its inputs. This means that if we switch two input elements in the sequence, e.g. $X_1\\leftrightarrow X_2$ (neglecting the batch dimension for now), the output is exactly the same besides the elements 1 and 2 switched. Hence, the multi-head attention is actually looking at the input not as a sequence, but as a set of elements. This property makes the multi-head attention block and the Transformer architecture so powerful and widely applicable! But what if the order of the input is actually important for solving the task, like language modeling? The answer is to encode the position in the input features, which we will take a closer look at later (topic _Positional encodings_ below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on to creating the Transformer architecture, we can compare the self-attention operation with our other common layer competitors for sequence data: convolutions and recurrent neural networks. Below you can find a table by [Vaswani et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) on the complexity per layer, the number of sequential operations, and maximum path length. The complexity is measured by the upper bound of the number of operations to perform, while the maximum path length represents the maximum number of steps a forward or backward signal has to traverse to reach any other position. The lower this length, the better gradient signals can backpropagate for long-range dependencies. Let's take a look at the table below:\n",

    "$n$ is the sequence length, $d$ is the representation dimension and $k$ is the kernel size of convolutions. In contrast to recurrent networks, the self-attention layer can parallelize all its operations making it much faster to execute for smaller sequence lengths. However, when the sequence length exceeds the hidden dimensionality, self-attention becomes more expensive than RNNs. One way of reducing the computational cost for long sequences is by restricting the self-attention to a neighborhood of inputs to attend over, denoted by $r$. Nevertheless, there has been recently a lot of work on more efficient Transformer architectures that still allow long dependencies, of which you can find an overview in the paper by [Tay et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06732) if interested."

    "### Transformer Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will look at how to apply the multi-head attention block inside the Transformer architecture. Originally, the Transformer model was designed for machine translation. Hence, it got an encoder-decoder structure where the encoder takes as input the sentence in the original language and generates an attention-based representation. On the other hand, the decoder attends over the encoded information and generates the translated sentence in an autoregressive manner, as in a standard RNN. While this structure is extremely useful for Sequence-to-Sequence tasks with the necessity of autoregressive decoding, we will focus here on the encoder part. Many advances in NLP have been made using pure encoder-based Transformer models (if interested, models include the [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)-family, the [Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929), and more), and in our tutorial, we will also mainly focus on the encoder part. If you have understood the encoder architecture, the decoder is a very small step to implement as well. The full Transformer architecture looks as follows (figure credit - [Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\"><img src=\"transformer_architecture.svg\" width=\"400px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder consists of $N$ identical blocks that are applied in sequence. Taking as input $x$, it is first passed through a Multi-Head Attention block as we have implemented above. The output is added to the original input using a residual connection, and we apply a consecutive Layer Normalization on the sum. Overall, it calculates $\\text{LayerNorm}(x+\\text{Multihead}(x,x,x))$ ($x$ being $Q$, $K$ and $V$ input to the attention layer). The residual connection is crucial in the Transformer architecture for two reasons: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Similar to ResNets, Transformers are designed to be very deep. Some models contain more than 24 blocks in the encoder. Hence, the residual connections are crucial for enabling a smooth gradient flow through the model.\n",
    "2. Without the residual connection, the information about the original sequence is lost. Remember that the Multi-Head Attention layer ignores the position of elements in a sequence, and can only learn it based on the input features. Removing the residual connections would mean that this information is lost after the first attention layer (after initialization), and with a randomly initialized query and key vector, the output vectors for position $i$ has no relation to its original input. All outputs of the attention are likely to represent similar/same information, and there is no chance for the model to distinguish which information came from which input element. An alternative option to residual connection would be to fix at least one head to focus on its original input, but this is very inefficient and does not have the benefit of the improved gradient flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Layer Normalization also plays an important role in the Transformer architecture as it enables faster training and provides small regularization. Additionally, it ensures that the features are in a similar magnitude among the elements in the sequence. We are not using Batch Normalization because it depends on the batch size which is often small with Transformers (they require a lot of GPU memory), and BatchNorm has shown to perform particularly bad in language as the features of words tend to have a much higher variance (there are many, very rare words which need to be considered for a good distribution estimate).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally to the Multi-Head Attention, a small fully connected feed-forward network is added to the model, which is applied to each position separately and identically. Specifically, the model uses a Linear$\\to$ReLU$\\to$Linear MLP. The full transformation including the residual connection can be expressed as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "    \\text{FFN}(x) & = \\max(0, xW_1+b_1)W_2 + b_2\\\\\n",
    "    x & = \\text{LayerNorm}(x + \\text{FFN}(x))\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This MLP adds extra complexity to the model and allows transformations on each sequence element separately. You can imagine as this allows the model to \"post-process\" the new information added by the previous Multi-Head Attention, and prepare it for the next attention block. Usually, the inner dimensionality of the MLP is 2-8$\\times$ larger than $d_{\\text{model}}$, i.e. the dimensionality of the original input $x$. The general advantage of a wider layer instead of a narrow, multi-layer MLP is the faster, parallelizable execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after looking at all parts of the encoder architecture, we can start implementing it below. We first start by implementing a single encoder block. Additionally to the layers described above, we will add dropout layers in the MLP and on the output of the MLP and Multi-Head Attention for regularization."

In tasks like language understanding, however, the position is important for interpreting the input words. The position information can therefore be added via the input features. We could learn a embedding for every possible position, but this would not generalize to a dynamical input sequence length. Hence, the better option is to use feature patterns that the network can identify from the features and potentially generalize to larger sequences.

We distinguish between even ($i \\text{ mod } 2=0$) and uneven ($i \\text{ mod } 2=1$) hidden dimensionalities where we apply a sine/cosine respectively. The intuition behind this encoding is that you can represent $PE_{(pos+k,:)}$ as a linear function of $PE_{(pos,:)}$, which might allow the model to easily attend to relative positions.

    "### Learning rate warm-up\n",
    "\n",
    "One commonly used technique for training a Transformer is learning rate warm-up. This means that we gradually increase the learning rate from 0 on to our originally specified learning rate in the first few iterations. Thus, we slowly start learning instead of taking very large steps from the beginning. In fact, training a deep Transformer without learning rate warm-up can make the model diverge and achieve a much worse performance on training and testing. Take for instance the following plot by [Liu et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.03265.pdf) comparing Adam-vanilla (i.e. Adam without warm-up) vs Adam with a warm-up:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center width=\"100%\"><img src=\"warmup_loss_plot.svg\" width=\"350px\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the warm-up is a crucial hyperparameter in the Transformer architecture. Why is it so important? There are currently two common explanations. Firstly, Adam uses the bias correction factors which however can lead to a higher variance in the adaptive learning rate during the first iterations. Improved optimizers like [RAdam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03265) have been shown to overcome this issue, not requiring warm-up for training Transformers. Secondly, the iteratively applied Layer Normalization across layers can lead to very high gradients during the first iterations, which can be solved by using [Pre-Layer Normalization](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/328-Paper.pdf) (similar to Pre-Activation ResNet), or replacing Layer Normalization by other techniques ([Adaptive Normalization](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/328-Paper.pdf), [Power Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07845)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, many applications and papers still use the original Transformer architecture with Adam, because warm-up is a simple, yet effective way of solving the gradient problem in the first iterations. There are many different schedulers we could use. For instance, the original Transformer paper used an exponential decay scheduler with a warm-up. However, the currently most popular scheduler is the cosine warm-up scheduler, which combines warm-up with a cosine-shaped learning rate decay. We can implement it below, and visualize the learning rate factor over epochs. "

    "\n",
    "Finally, we can embed the Transformer architecture into a PyTorch lightning module. From Tutorial 5, you know that PyTorch Lightning simplifies our training and test code, as well as structures the code nicely in separate functions. We will implement a template for a classifier based on the Transformer encoder. Thereby, we have a prediction output per sequence element. If we would need a classifier over the whole sequence, the common approach is to add an additional `[CLS]` token to the sequence, representing the classifier token. However, here we focus on tasks where we have an output per element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally to the Transformer architecture, we add a small input network (maps input dimensions to model dimensions), the positional encoding, and an output network (transforms output encodings to predictions). We also add the learning rate scheduler, which takes a step each iteration instead of once per epoch. This is needed for the warmup and the smooth cosine decay. The training, validation, and test step is left empty for now and will be filled for our task-specific models."

    "A Sequence-to-Sequence task represents a task where the input _and_ the output is a sequence, not necessarily of the same length. Popular tasks in this domain include machine translation and summarization. For this, we usually have a Transformer encoder for interpreting the input sequence, and a decoder for generating the output in an autoregressive manner. Here, however, we will go back to a much simpler example task and use only the encoder. Given a sequence of $N$ numbers between $0$ and $M$, the task is to reverse the input sequence. In Numpy notation, if our input is $x$, the output should be $x$[::-1]. Although this task sounds very simple, RNNs can have issues with such because the task requires long-term dependencies. Transformers are built to support such, and hence, we expect it to perform very well. \n",

    "During training, we pass the input sequence through the Transformer encoder and predict the output for each input token. We use the standard Cross-Entropy loss to perform this. Every number is represented as a one-hot vector. Remember that representing the categories as single scalars decreases the expressiveness of the model extremely as $0$ and $1$ are not closer related than $0$ and $9$ in our example. An alternative to a one-hot vector is using a learned embedding vector as it is provided by the PyTorch module `nn.Embedding`. However, using a one-hot vector with an additional linear layer as in our case has the same effect as an embedding layer (`self.input_net` maps one-hot vector to a dense vector, where each row of the weight matrix represents the embedding for a specific category).\n",

    "Finally, we can create a training function similar to the one we have seen in Tutorial 5 for PyTorch Lightning. We create a `pl.Trainer` object, running for $N$ epochs, logging in TensorBoard, and saving our best model based on the validation. Afterward, we test our models on the test set. An additional parameter we pass to the trainer here is `gradient_clip_val`. This clips the norm of the gradients for all parameters before taking an optimizer step and prevents the model from diverging if we obtain very high gradients at, for instance, sharp loss surfaces (see many good blog posts on gradient clipping, like [DeepAI glossary](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/gradient-clipping)). For Transformers, gradient clipping can help to further stabilize the training during the first few iterations, and also afterward. In plain PyTorch, you can apply gradient clipping via `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(...)` (see [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_.html#torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_)). The clip value is usually between 0.5 and 10, depending on how harsh you want to clip large gradients. After having explained this, let's implement the training function:"

    "The model has learned to attend to the token that is on the flipped index of itself. Hence, it actually does what we intended it to do. We see that it however also pays some attention to values close to the flipped index. This is because the model doesn't need the perfect, hard attention to solve this problem, but is fine with this approximate, noisy attention map. The close-by indices are caused by the similarity of the positional encoding, which we also intended with the positional encoding."

It should be noted that you might see slightly different scores depending on what computer/device you are running this notebook. This is because despite setting the seed before generating the test dataset, it is not the same across platforms and numpy versions. Nevertheless, we can conclude that the model performs quite well and can solve the task for most sets. Before trying to interpret the model, let's verify that our model is permutation-equivariant, and assigns the same predictions for different permutations of the input set. For this, we sample a batch from the test set and run it through the model to obtain the probabilities. "
